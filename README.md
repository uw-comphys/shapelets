# What is shapelets? 

shapelets is a python package that implements several shapelet functions and some of their significant applications in science and astronomy. These functions form a complete and orthonormal set, allowing them to capture complex geometries and information from any physical shape. Furthermore, shapelets are localized and can be scaled to match that of any physical feature. 

Due to these properties, they have seen extensive use in recent years, with several different formulations and applications:

* Astronomy/astrophysics ([A. Refregier (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x), [R. Massey (2005)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0408445), [J. Berge (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1903.05837))
* Nanomaterials ([R. Suderman (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.033307), [T. Akdeniz (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aaf353), [M. P. Tino (2024)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ad1df4))
* Computational neuroscience ([J. D. Victor (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00498.2005), [T. O. Sharpee (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10827-008-0107-5))
* Medical imaging ([J. Weissman (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPEX.12.005760))

The shapelets package provides reference documentation and code for four (4) shapelet functions: 

* Cartesian shapelets ([A. Refregier (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x)), 
* Polar shapelets ([R. Massey (2005)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0408445)),
* Orthonormal polar shapelets with constant radial scale ([T. Akdeniz (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aaf353)), and 
* Exponential shapelets ([J. Berge (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1903.05837))

# Getting Started

Users are directed to the shapelets [official website](https://mptino.github.io/shapelets/shapelets.html) for all documentation, including installation instructions, detailed examples, and more. 

# Contribute

The authors of the shapelets package welcome external contributions to the source code. This process will be easiest if users adhere to the contribution policy:

* Open an issue on the package [issue tracker](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets/issues) clearly describing your intentions on code modifications or additions
* Ensure your modifications or additions adhere to the existing standard of the shapelets package, specifically detailed documentation for new methods (see existing methods for example documentation)
* Test your modifications to ensure that the core functionality of the package has not been altered by running the unit tests via the custom command: `shapelets-test`
* Once the issue has been discussed with a package author, you may open a pull request containing your modifications
