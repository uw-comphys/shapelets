# Custom Commands

The shapelets package makes use of [entry points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/), which are custom command-line arguments that trigger specific tasks.

* `shapelets CONFIG` - here, `CONFIG` is the name of the plaintext configuration file that will run specific package methods based on the parameters listed in the file
* `shapelets-test` - triggers all unit tests in the [tests](https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets/tree/main/tests) directory and will report any failures. It is encouraged to use this command if modifying the package source code and after initial package [installation](https://uw-comphys.github.io/shapelets/shapelets/docs/installation.html)

# Methods of Usage 

The shapelets package can be used in two different formats.

1. Configuration file method (developed for non-programmers)
    * Parameters are described in a plaintext file, and the code then reads these parameters and runs the relevant code in the background
2. Scripting method (intended for programmers)
    * A more traditional format where relevant methods are imported in python files, i.e. 
    ```python 
    from shapelets.functions import cartesian2D
    ```

All [examples](https://uw-comphys.github.io/shapelets/shapelets/docs/examples.html) provide implementation using both the configuration file method and scripting method.
