# Package Interfacing

The `shapelets` package can be interfaced in two different ways:

1. Configuration file method (developed for non-programmers)
    * Parameters are described in a text-based configuration file, and the `shapelets` package then reads this file and runs the appropriate analysis
2. Scripting method (intended for those comfortable with Python programming)
    * A more traditional format where relevant methods are imported in python files, i.e. 

```python 
from shapelets.functions import cartesian2D
```

The [examples](https://uw-comphys.github.io/shapelets/shapelets/docs.html) are implemented via the text-based configuration file method (#1 above).
However, these examples also have associated Python files (.py) that perform the exact same analysis as shown via the configuration file method.
