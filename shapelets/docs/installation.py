# Installation Instructions

shapelets requires Python 3.10 or greater.
Installing shapelets is highly dependent on the operating system of your machine, be sure to follow the appropriate guidelines.

## Mac OS

Please ensure your macOS is at least macOS 12 Monterey (released 2021).

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by copy and pasting the command website homepage into your terminal
2. Install `git`, `python3.10`, and `pip` in the terminal: `brew install git python@3.10` (automatically installs pip) 
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/uw-comphys/shapelets.git`
4. Navigate to the top-most directory (i.e. ./shapelets) and install this package: `pip3.10 install .`
5. Ensure correct installation by running the unit tests [custom command](https://uw-comphys.github.io/shapelets/shapelets/docs/usage.html) on the CLI: `shapelets-test`

## Windows

The instructions for Windows use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). 

1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS from the Microsoft Store 
2. Open Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and create a Unix profile (username and password) 
3. If the following error occurs: `WSLRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80370102`, follow these steps
	* Open *Turn Windows Features on and off*, and enable the following
	* *Virtual Machine Platform*, *Windows Subsystem for Linux*, and *Hyper-V* (if available) 
	* Restart your PC and return to step 2
4. Update your Ubuntu system:  `sudo apt-get update`
5. Install `git`, `python3.10`, `pip`, and a graphics library: `sudo apt-get install git python3.10 python3-pip libgl1-mesa-glx`

**Note** - if this is your first time installing Ubuntu on WSL, you may also need to follow the [enable graphics](https://uw-comphys.github.io/shapelets/shapelets/docs/WSL.html) instructions to allow graphics support (i.e. figures from `matplotlib`).
