# What is shapelets? 

shapelets is a python package that implements several shapelet functions and some of their significant applications in science and astronomy. These functions form a complete and orthonormal set, allowing them to capture complex geometries and information from any physical shape. Furthermore, shapelets are localized and can be scaled to match that of any physical feature. 

Due to these properties, they have seen extensive use in recent years, with several different formulations and applications:

* Astronomy/astrophysics ([A. Refregier (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x), [R. Massey (2005)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0408445), [J. Berge (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1903.05837))
* Nanomaterials ([R. Suderman (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.033307), [T. Akdeniz (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aaf353), [M. P. Tino (2024)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ad1df4))
* Computational neuroscience ([J. D. Victor (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00498.2005), [T. O. Sharpee (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10827-008-0107-5))
* Medical imaging ([J. Weissman (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPEX.12.005760))

The shapelets package provides reference documentation and code for four (4) shapelet functions: 

* Cartesian shapelets ([A. Refregier (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.05901.x)), 
* Polar shapelets ([R. Massey (2005)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0408445)),
* Orthonormal polar shapelets with constant radial scale ([T. Akdeniz (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/aaf353)), and 
* Exponential shapelets ([J. Berge (2019)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1903.05837))
