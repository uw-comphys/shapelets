def get_wavelength(image, rng = [0, 50], verbose = True):
    r""" Find characteristic wavelength of an image from [1, 2].

    matthew@matthew: The rng needs to be optimized better. 
    For example, if the wavelength is bigger than 50 need to fix this.
    But, if we just let rng = None (i.e., all wavelengths) then it will
    find way too big of a wavelength as the scale...
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        The image to be processed.
    rng : list
        Range of wavelengths to consider for maximum wavelength.
        I.e., will return max wavelength in range of [0, 50] (default). 

    Returns
    -------
    l : float or list
        The characteristic wavelength of the image.
